** WEB FORMS **
-------------------------------------------------------------
-> It is a web application framework under ASP.NET, that allows the developers to build Dynamic, Event-Driven web applications using C#.


-> Thus, it makes applications in a way, that it feels very similar to Windows Forms (i.e. desktop apps).

-> It Abstracts the Complexities of HTML, HTTP, and JavaScript, letting developers work with server-side controls and events.

  By Abstracting the Complexities, it means:

-> Web Forms hides the low-level web details (like HTML rendering, HTTP requests, JavaScript) from the developer, and provides simpler, higher-level C# constructs instead.

- (C# constructs are the Built-In Language Elements, Structures, and Features of C# that we use to write logic.)
